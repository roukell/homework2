    "bio":"My name is Melody Lo. I am a Junior Web Developer and I am an accomplished coder and programmer. I enjoy using my skills to solve real life problems and build functional websites. I graduated from the University of Sydney The Coding Bootcamp in 2020 with a Master's Degree in Nuclear Medicine. While in the bootcamp, I applied the knowledge that I have learned, and created several functional websites. I have experience in using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, API, Express, Node.js, React, mySQL, Bootstrap, and responsive design. I am obsessed with building websites that are highly interactive and with beautiful UI. I spend most of my free time developing my own project. I enjoy watching sci-fi movies and animation, looking into new tech products online, working out and eating nice food at local restaurants.",
